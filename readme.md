# Select45
Select45 aims to be a very simple and straightforward alternative to much more complex select box libraries. Our team has tried many of these libraries that allow styling of select boxes, and have grown increasingly frustrated with how difficult it is to add custom styling to them, to make them WCAG 2.1 AA compliant, and to modify their functionality. We decided to roll our own to solve all of these issues.

## Basic Usage

`Select45(string [selector])`

The selector can be either an ID or class. Support for full CSS-style selectors has not been tested yet.

### Examples

`Select45('#my-id');`

`Select45('.my-class');`

## Roadmap

We plan to add a few more features to this, such as callbacks and the ability to set a few options, but our goal is to keep this project in the spirit of simplicity, so we'll keep from feature creeping it too much.
